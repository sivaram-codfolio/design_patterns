# Go Design Patterns

A collection of commonly used design patterns implemented in Go. This repository serves as a reference for developers looking to understand, implement, and apply design patterns effectively in real-world Go applications.

🚀 *Patterns Covered**

✅ Builder Pattern – Step-by-step object construction with a fluent API.

🏗 **Builder Pattern**

The Builder Pattern helps construct complex objects in a structured manner. Here’s an example implementation using a Notification Builder:

```bash
go run builder/main.go builder/notification.go builder/builder.go
Notification: &{Title:New Notification SubTitle:This is a subtitle Message:This is a basic notification Image:image.jpg Icon:icon.png Priority:5 Type:alert}
```

📌 **Future Plans**

This repository will continue to grow with more design patterns, including:
- Singleton
- Factory
- Adapter
- Observer
- Strategy
- …and more!

Stay tuned for updates. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
